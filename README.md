# Conta-Salario
Study project for dunder mothods to be able to compare objects as values.

As we implement the methods ```__eq__``` and ```__lt__``` we can compare objects from another (if they are equal, lesser than, etc).  
That also makes us able to order objects, since ordering is basically comparing values, which we assumed for the object in question based on the attribute ```saldo```.
